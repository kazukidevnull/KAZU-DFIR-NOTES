# KAZU'S DFIR TRIAGE FILES

## THIS TRIAGE DIRECTORY IS FOR ALL NOTES AND SUCH RELATED TO PERFORMING WINDOWS TRIAGE, HOWEVER, THIS WHOLE REPO IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND ANYTHING FOUND IN THIS DIRECTORY (OR ANY OF MY OTHER REPO'S FOR THAT MATTER) IS INCOMPLETE AND LACKS A LOT OF PROPER FORMATTING, INFORMATION AND ACCURACY, IT ALSO LIKELY CONTAINS A LOT OF TYPOS AS I AM LITERALLY WRITING EVERYTHING AS I GO WITH MORE FOCUS ON GETTING SOMETHING DOWN THEN MAKING EVERYTHING PROPER(FOR NOW A LEAST), 

### Additionally, this directory currently lack most information as i am focusing on a least getting some more notes down in the "General-DFIR-Notes" firectory before i start putting together a actually triage document.

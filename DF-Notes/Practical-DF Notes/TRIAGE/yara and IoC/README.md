Within this directory you will find various documents containing various yara rules and IoC's, at first i planned to just dump it all in same document, but then i figured it would properly be best to a least attempt keep everything more organized, thus, there will be multiple documents which should have yara rules or IoC's related to various types.

Below are a list of yar files and directories found within this directory and what you can expect from each of them, the name of the document should generally be self-explanatory.

rules and IoC's with "KL" as part of the name are ones that are created by Kazuki-Labs while the ones in the external folder are ones created by others

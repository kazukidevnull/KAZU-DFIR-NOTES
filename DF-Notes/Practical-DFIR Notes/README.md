# KAZU'S Practical DFIR notes
This directory is for all notes and such related to notes related to actual performing triage, investigation and such compared to the "General-DFIR-Notes" directory which are more a factual knowledge base about how various things work while this directory is more about the practical aspect of actually doing it such as how, when and various tips and tricks which may be helpful, also, it will optimally be structured and written in a way that is both easy to view and digest to avoid looking all over the place when having to try do something quickly
 
However, this whole repo is still a work in progress and anything found in this directory (or any of my other repo's for that matter) is incomplete and lacks a lot of proper formatting, information and accuracy, it also likely contains a lot of typos as i am literally writing everything as i go with more focus on getting something down then making everything proper(for now a least),

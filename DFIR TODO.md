## KAZU-DFIR-NOTES-TODO

The purpose of this document is trying to put down various things i want to get around to do at some point related to things to include, layouts and other ideas i have to possible improve things





+ In regards to the main documents with all the DFIR notes: having one big document with all kinds of information scattered everywhere is not really helpful in the long run, so re-organizing everything at some point in the future may be a good idea, how is TBD.

+ Should properly change things in the futre in relation to where each infomation is stored as right now it's not good to know if what is in linux or window directory are things done TO or ON linux or windows, for instance, should a linux too used for windows forensic be placed in the linux or windows directory?

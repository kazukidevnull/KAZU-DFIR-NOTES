This document have various notes that are related to things such as capabilities, equipment and such which are needed or recommended to make investigations of any incident effective or possible such as recommended loadout, kits, tools and other stuff.



## Pre-investigation considerations

there's many things that need to be in order before you can start any kind of investigation,

Regardless if it's in the field or a lab enviroment, there's many things that need to be considered such as hardware, personnel and training budget, some of the things will be one-time costs while other things will not and be part of ongoing expenses, knowing what is what beforehand is important.

### One-time Expenses

### Infrequently Ongoing Costs

### Frequently Ongoing Costs(such as single-use items)

## Response Kit


## Forensic Workstation

This very much depends on various things such as budget and planned use, but here is some minimum recommendations.

generally more more RAM and better CPU can greatly speed up everything, using SSD for aquisition and processing is also highly recommended as transfer speed is frequently a bottle-neck, with that said, while they are getting very cheap, they can wear quickly and offers limited space compared to regular HDD, so HDD is recommended for storage of large amount of data when possible or when speed is not essential, with that out of the way, here is the following recommendations based upon minimum, medium and optimal specs

### Desktop(Recommended Specs)

Minimum Spec:

+ RAM:16gb
+ CPU: 
+ SSD: 1x 500TB
+ HDD: 1x 2TB
+ GPU
Medium Specs:

+ RAM:32gb
+ CPU: 
+ SSD: 1x 1TB
+ HDD: 2x 2TB
+ GPU

Optimal Specs:

+ RAM:128gb
+ CPU: 
+ SSD: 1x 2TB
+ HDD: 3x 5TB
+ GPU

### Laptop(Recommended Specs)

Minimum Spec:

+ RAM: 16gb
+ CPU:i5
+ 1TB SSD
+ GPU

Medium Specs:

+ RAM: 32gb
+ CPU:i7
+ 2TB SSD
+ GPU


Optimal Specs:

+ RAM: 64gb
+ CPU:i7
+ m.2: x2 2TB SSD in double slot sata enclosure(this can either be used more RAID1 or to increase storage to 4tb)
+ GPU

## Response kit

Having a well put together response kit can make the whole difference between everything going easily and smoothly and not, the exact contents will vary of course from personal choice, time, place, purpose and such, so the kit need to be changed to suit the person's or organizations requirementes/needs, here is some general guidelines however which many IR people have found helpful


General response kit consist of the following:

+ Digital Camera
+ Disposible Gloves
+ Notepads
+ organizational paperwork
+ paper storage bags
+ Anti-static bags
+ Storage media
+ Write blocking device
+ Frequency Shielding material
+ Toolkit
+ Forensic Laptop
+ misc stuff

### general response kit Details

details regarding each of the things listed above as well as other extra notes regarding Response kits

**Digital Camera:**
+ Documenting before and during a IR/Investigation is important, to this end a digital camera that can take photos and videos is important, if you only need to take photos or/and video will be up to either the organizations decision or personal choice, if you video record, then turning the microphone off is recommended as sometimes the discussion or language can distract from the presentation of evidence.

    if you want to record audio as well in case of something, it is recommended using a own audio recording device for such, also, while it's tempted to just use a smartphone for video/photos instead of dedicated camera, it's highly advisable against doing such as that can both create extra legal headache and complex the work flow.

**Dispossible Gloves:**
+ This should go without saying, but doing any kind of investigations without dispossible gloves is bad practice, both for legal reasons but also that there's so much things you may not want to touch directly, recommend against latex gloves and gloves that have powder in them as they can cause unwanted problems.

**Notepads:**
+ regardless if you video record your actions or not, you still need to document actions on the scene and there will be a lot if information that you need to remember when you arrive and remembering it all is impossible, some organizations also want a sketch of the area as well and other things where a pen and paper is important.

    While you still need a notepad around for various things, some things can possible be replaced by a dedicated tabled with a digital pen to take the notes and draw things as that can make things a lot easier and allow for speeding up workflow, depending on the tabled and such, you can possible even use the tabled to replace a camera as nowadays they are often in high enough quality and can both take photos and record video, since this will be a DEDICATED tabled used ONLY for investigations, it should provide little problems, a dedicated digital camera is still recommended having present for cases when multiple people need to document things or when the tablet can not be used, trust me, when you find yourself without power on it or is broken, you will be thankful you did.

**Organizational paperwork:**
+ this are things such labels, tags for digital evidences, property report for seized evidence which list exactly what was taken, from where, any identifying marks or serial numbers and other stuff like that

**Paper storage bags/antistatic bags**
+ you need to store and protect various evidences both from being damaged and from unauthorized access, to this end both paper bags and anti-static bags for electronic devices is important.

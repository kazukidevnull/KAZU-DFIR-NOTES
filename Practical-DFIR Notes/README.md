# KAZU'S DFIR TRIAGE FILES
This directory is for all notes and such related to notes about performing actual triage and investigation, it will optimally be structured and written in a way that is both easy to view and digest, 
 
However, this whole repo is still a work in progress and anything found in this directory (or any of my other repo's for that matter) is incomplete and lacks a lot of proper formatting, information and accuracy, it also likely contains a lot of typos as i am literally writing everything as i go with more focus on getting something down then making everything proper(for now a least),

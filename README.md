## KAZU-DFIR-NOTES


### This repo is for all of the various notes in regards to DIFR, DFIR TRIAGE, and such


### PLEASE NOTE!: EVERYTHING FOUND IN THIS REPO IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND EVERYTHING YOU SEE IS NOT FINAL, ACCURATE OR FREE OF TYPO'S AS I AM LITERALLY WRITING EVERYTHING AS I GO WITH MORE FOCUS ON GETTING SOMETHING DOWN THEN MAKING EVERYTHING PROPER(FOR NOW A LEAST), 

### Also, as i am still trying to figure out what the best way to format everything and what works and what does not work, a lot of things such as layout will be inconsistent.

-----

This repo is currently made public mainly for the reason to have more of my own repo on github and show that i do "something", if the notes is of any help to someone else, then that's nice of course, but not currently my main goal, similar repo related to CTI, RE, MALWARE and such are planned to be made public in the future, but first focus on the DFIR one and then move on the others later once this one is no longer such a disaster. 

it takes time to write everything and some things i may know about, but not enough to write detailed notes about it from memory, thus i go trough every subject and topics to make sure i get all the important details down, yes, even the ones i feel i know very well.

TO AVOID PUSHING FOR EVERY MINOR CHANGE AND FILL UP THE PUSH-HISTORY, I WILL MOSTLY PUSH MONTHLY OR WHEN I FEEL I GOT ENOUGH CONTENT TO WARRANT A PUSH (whichever comes first)

I MAY ALSO PUSH FOR IMPORTANT CHANGES/UPDATE THAT CAN NOT WAIT UNTIL NEXT MAJOR UPDATE 

WHILE YOU ARE WELCOME TO CONTACT ME TO BE ADDED TO THE REPO AS A 
CONTRIBUTOR, I WILL NOT AT AT THIS TIME ACCEPT PR FROM PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW YET AND ACTIVELY WORK TOGETHER WITH ON THIS, THIS IS MAINLY TO AVOID HEADACHE DEALING WITH CONFLICTS WHEN I PUSH A LOT AT ONCE.

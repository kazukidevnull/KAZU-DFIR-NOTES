# KAZU-DFIR-NOTES

## This repo is for all of the various notes in regards to DIFR, DFIR TRIAGE, and such

## This repo is currently made public purely for the reason to have more of my own repo on github and show what i am currently working on, similiar repo related to CTI, RE and MALWARE are planned in the future, but in a attempt to avoid doing too much at once, i will first focus on the DFIR one and then move on the others later once this one is no longer a disaster. 

 ### PLEASE NOTE!: EVERYTHING FOUND IN THIS REPO IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND EVERYTHING YOU SEE IS NOT FINAL, ACCURATE OR FREE TYPO'S AS I AM LITERALLY WRITING EVERYHTING AS I GO WITH MORE FOCUS ON GETTING SOMETHING DOWN THEN MAKING EVERYTHING PROPER(FOR NOW A LEAST), 
 
 ### ALSO, TO AVOID PUSHING FOR EVERY MINOR CHANGE AND FILL UP THE PUSH-HISTORY WITH MINOR CHANGES, I WILL ONLY PUSH MONTHLY OR WHEN I FEEL I GOT ENOUGH CONTENT TO WARRANT A PUSH(whichever comes first)
 
 ### WHILE YOU ARE WELCOME TO CONTACT ME TO BE ADDED TO THE REPO AS A CONTRIBUTOR, I WILL NOT AT AT THIS TIME ACCEPT PR FROM PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW YET AND ACTIVELY WORK TOGETHER WITH ON THIS, THIS IS MAINLY TO AVOID HEADACHE DEALING WITH CONFLICTS WHEN I PUSH A LOT AT ONCE.
